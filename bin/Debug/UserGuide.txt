Quick Start Guide:
Welcome to 2DO – the most efficient way to “Plan your life ahead”. This quick start guide will acquaint you with the features of the products and provide you guidelines on how to use them.
Commands:
In the screenshot above, there is a Command Box on the top right of the window where you can enter commands for manipulating events. The list of commands and their uses are given below:
1. ADD
This utility allows you to create an event and also add details like the description and the deadline for completion. You can either enter the following command in the Command Box or click on the icon in the bottom right corner of the window.
Ex: Add event “Dinner” at “Pizza Hut” start “2/9/11” end “2/9/11” from “8.00 pm” to “10.00 pm” duration “0.5 hr” priority “high” reminder “1 hr”
The data entered by you will appear within quotes automatically. The last field ‘reminder’ enables the reminder service for the event. Among all the above fields, only ‘event’, ‘location’, ‘start time’ and ‘duration’ are essential. If the rest of the fields are not mentioned then the event’s deadline is assumed to be on the same day and is given medium priority. The added event is then shown in the table below along with other details.
Note: You can use our “Smart Slots” feature to schedule the event in your day’s timetable. To learn more about how to use this feature ,please proceed to ‘Smart Slots’ section.
2. DELETE
This utility allows you to delete existing events. You can execute it through the Command Box or by selecting the event and clicking on the icon in the bottom right corner.
Ex: Delete ID “12”
The above command will delete the event no. 12.
3. EDIT
You can edit existing events’ details using this command.

This resets the corresponding fields with the newly entered information. The event is identified using the ID Number. Instead you can also select the event and click on the icon. Any of the fields can be modified any time.
